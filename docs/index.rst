Battery System Designer (``BaSD``)
==================================

    Automated, requirements driven battery system design

The Battery System Designer (``BaSD``) tool is tool to support the design
process, layout and optimization of battery systems during development.

``BaSD`` uses the basic, formalized requirements for a battery system from an
electrical point of view (e.g., minimum and maximum system voltage, maximum
discharge current etc.) and a mechanical point of view (i.e., the design space)
and transfers this into a battery system configuration that satisfies these
requirements.
``BaSD`` uses a database of available cells to find these possible battery
system configurations.
